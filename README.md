# Pocket Dota

React Native app that displays heroes, items and player statistics

[App landing page](http://pocket-dota.info)


# CONTRIBUTING
Pocket Dota is developed using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), via [Expo](http://expo.io).

### Prerequisites
- [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- [expo-cli](https://expo.io/tools#cli) - just run ```yarn global add expo-cli```

## Development
- [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
- ```yarn``` or ```npm install``` in the root folder
- ```expo start``` in the root folder
- on an (Android/ IOS) emulator, or on an actual physical device, install the Expo client (the expo-cli can do that for emulators, read the [docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli)). It's much easier on an Android emulator/ device, as for IOS you have to own an app in order to view it with Expo
- ... Javascript/ React Native away!
